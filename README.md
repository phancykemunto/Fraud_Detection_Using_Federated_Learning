Introduction

Fraudulent transactions are one of the biggest challenges in today’s financial world. A stolen credit card used for online shopping, a fake account transferring money across borders, or a sudden spike in unusual payments—these can cost millions of dollars in losses and erode customer trust overnight.

Now imagine global networks like Visa, MasterCard, or PayPal. Each handles millions of transactions daily. On their own, they may detect certain fraud patterns, but many fraudsters operate across multiple platforms, making it hard for any single institution to see the full picture.

Here’s the problem: while these organizations could benefit from sharing data to strengthen fraud detection, privacy laws and security concerns prevent them from exchanging sensitive customer information.

This is where Federated Learning (FL) comes in. With FL, each institution trains a model locally on its own transaction data, then securely shares only the model updates (not raw data) with a central server. The server aggregates these updates to improve a global fraud detection model.

This way, Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, and even banks can collaboratively detect fraud patterns that none of them could catch alone—without ever compromising customer privacy.

This project explores how federated learning can be applied to financial fraud detection by simulating multiple institutions training models on their own data and combining their knowledge into a stronger global model. By doing so, it demonstrates the potential of FL to enhance fraud detection accuracy while safeguarding sensitive financial information.

Problem Statement

The key challenge addressed in this project is detecting fraudulent financial transactions across multiple institutions without compromising data privacy. Traditional centralized approaches require pooling sensitive data in one location, which poses serious risks in terms of security, compliance, and user trust. At the same time, isolated models at individual institutions often lack the broader fraud patterns needed for effective detection. This project seeks to solve this dilemma by leveraging federated learning, which enables collaborative model training while ensuring that raw transaction data never leaves its source.
